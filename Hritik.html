    <h1>Introduction to class</h1>
    <p>we are here to conduct a workshop on the topic git and open source.<br>
    As this are the one the most important things that every techie should know.</p>

    <h2>Git or version control</h2>
    <p>
        What is “version control”, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file<br>
         or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this book, you will use software source code as the
        <br> files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.

    <br>
    <h2>Open-source</h2>
    <p>
        Open-source software (OSS) is computer software that is released under a license in which <br>
        the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software<br>
         and its source code to anyone and for any purpose.[1][2] Open-source software may be developed<br>
         in a collaborative, public manner. Open-source software is a prominent example of open collaboration,<br>
          meaning any capable user is able to participate online in development, making the number of possible <br>
          contributors indefinite. The ability to examine the code facilitates public trust in the software.[3]
